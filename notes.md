## Techniques used
### API
- Using their API, I got the data for my project from the oldbaileyonline.org. Initially I was just going to use highway robbers in general, but having noticed some of their search refining features, I opted to focus instead on the trials involving women during the, for lack of a better term, "golden age" of highway robbery. Had some technical issues using their API as it works differently from most of the APIs I've used before, but I was able to quickly put together some python code that got the first 100 results that came up when searching for women involved in highway robbery and convert the result from xml to csv. 
### Excel
- Excel was mainly used here for reformatting the data so I could do more with it than I could with the default formatting. Mainly by separating the verdict, date, and sentence from the rest of the description, which had to be done manually. 
### R
- R was very useful in performing certain analytical tasks relating to the data, specifically in quantify the number of reoccurences of a certain term in a column, such as counting the number of Non Guilty and Guilty verdicts or the various punishments that were handed down to those found guilty. Additionally R was useful in generating the charts that would go on the graph. 
### Voyant
- Voyant was used without a hitch to make the corpus that is present in the middle of the poster. It was also used to get the information for the bottom part which details the most commonly stolen goods.
